# Nordstrom

**A brief Twitter analysis** - Python Notebook is available <a href="https://github.com/rwk506/Nordstrom/blob/master/Twitter%20-%20Nordstrom.ipynb">here</a>.



</br></br>
**Summary**

Recent events have led to Nordstrom dropping a line of their clothing from their typical lineup (http://n.pr/2ktyVqt). This led to all sorts of reactions from a variety of sources.

The goal of this project is to examine the reaction on Twitter to these two events: the initial coverage on February 3rd and the followup response on February 8th. I use the Twitter API to gather tweets with the #Nordstrom tag and analyze the occurence, sentiment, and popularity of the tweets. I also bring in stock price data for comparison. To ruin the ending - Nordstrom seems safe.

<h4>Dependencies</h4>

This Python code was written using Python 2.7, but should be compatible with many other versions. The tweepy package and the Twitter API must be installed and set up. The user may also have to install the matplotlib and pylab packages.
